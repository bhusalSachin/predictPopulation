# predictPopulation
A local biologist needs a program to predict population growth. The inputs would be:  The initial number of organisms The rate of growth (a real number greater than 1) The number of hours it takes to achieve this rate A number of hours during which the population grows For example, one might start with a population of 500 organisms, a growth rate of 2, and a growth period to achieve this rate of 6 hours. Assuming that none of the organisms die, this would imply that this population would double in size every 6 hours. Thus, after allowing 6 hours for growth, we would have 1000 organisms, and after 12 hours, we would have 2000 organisms.  Write a program that takes these inputs and displays a prediction of the total population.
